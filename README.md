According to Maslow, love and belongingness are one of the innate needs of human beings.[^1]
Thus, human connection has played a significant role throughout human life in various contexts, such as building physical connections with face-to-face conversations or hugs.

However, we are currently witnessing a Renaissance of social connection through technology. Particularly, platforms like Tinder, emblematic of the online dating market, have introduced a new dating culture. On this platform, algorithms function as matchmakers, aiding us in finding genuine connections by recommending potential matches tailored to individual preferences and behavioral data, thereby expanding our social circles.

Yet, various factors, including behavioral addiction, obsession with online self-presentation, and the absence of physical meetups, can impact the quality of relationships. Therefore, to achieve a deeper understanding of modern relationships, it is crucial to be more conscious about the entire journey of how we fall in love via a machine.
